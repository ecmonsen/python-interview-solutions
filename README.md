# Python Practice

Example Python project with solutions to a few Python "interview-style" problems found on the internet.

Keep in mind these are demonstrations of basic Python concepts that I might expect to code within an hour-long live 
technical screening.

Check out `sum_to_n()` to see a demonstration of recursion and use of `yield`.

Unit tests demonstrate the solutions.

Object orientation examples in `gene_identifier.py`

## Style notes
The project uses a vanilla Python project structure and Python standard unit tests.

I have made an effort to PyDoc my functions for readability.

On more complex projects, I expect to either (a) conform to the team's accepted standards or (b) review my chosen style
prior to submitting pull requests.

## Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: Requires Python 3.9 or later.

## Try it

```bash
python3 -m venv venv # or your choice of python >= 3.9
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover
```

## Project structure

* `practice/` - Code
* `test/` - Unit tests
