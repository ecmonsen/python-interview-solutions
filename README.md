# Python Practice

Example Python project with solutions to a few Python "interview-style" problems found on the internet.

Unit tests demonstrate the solutions.

## Style notes
The project uses a vanilla Python project structure and Python standard unit tests.

I have made an effort to PyDoc my functions for readability.

On more complex projects, I expect to either (a) conform to the team's accepted standards or (b) review my chosen style
prior to submitting pull requests.

## Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: Requires Python 3.9 or later.

## Try it

`python -m unittest discover`

## Project structure

* `practice/` - Code
* `test/` - Unit tests
